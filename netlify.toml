# Note: Netlify does not support built-in cron jobs like Vercel.
# For the WhatsApp scheduled messages (reminders, follow-ups), use an external cron service:
#
# Option 1: cron-job.org (free tier, up to 4 jobs)
#   - URL: GET https://your-site.netlify.app/api/whatsapp/cron?token=YOUR_CRON_SECRET
#   - Schedule: Every 5 minutes (*/5 * * * *)
#
# Option 2: Upstash QStash (serverless cron, generous free tier)
#   - Configure via Upstash dashboard
#   - Set destination URL and Bearer token
#
# Option 3: EasyCron (free tier, 1 job)
#   - URL: GET https://your-site.netlify.app/api/whatsapp/cron
#   - Header: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
#   - Schedule: Every 5 minutes
